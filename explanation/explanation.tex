\section*{Introduction}

This report provides an explanation of the tests conducted to analyze the performance of our maze resolution algorithm, along with the results obtained. The primary objective was to evaluate the time and space complexities of the algorithm in practical scenarios and to verify its scalability and efficiency. We conducted experiments on mazes of varying sizes to observe how the algorithm behaves as the maze dimensions increase.

\section*{Testing Methodology}

\subsection*{Test Setup}

To systematically assess the performance, we developed an automated testing framework comprising:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A shell script to generate mazes of different sizes.
    \item Execution of the maze resolution algorithm on each generated maze.
    \item Measurement of execution time and memory usage for each test case.
    \item Collection and analysis of the performance data.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Maze Generation}

We generated mazes with dimensions ranging from $10 \times 10$ to $1000 \times 1000$, increasing in increments of $50$. Each maze was generated using our recursive division algorithm to ensure randomness and variability in the maze structure.

\subsection*{Performance Metrics}

The key performance metrics measured were:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Execution Time:} Total time taken by the algorithm to solve the maze.
    \item \textbf{Memory Usage:} Peak memory consumption during the algorithm's execution.
\end{itemize}

We utilized the \texttt{time} command for execution time measurements and \texttt{valgrind} with the \texttt{massif} tool for memory profiling.

\section*{Analysis of Results}

\subsection*{Execution Time}

The execution time increases approximately quadratically with the maze size. This trend is consistent with the theoretical time complexity of the BFS algorithm when applied to a grid-based maze.

\subsubsection*{Quadratic Growth Explanation}

In a maze of size $n \times n$:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The number of cells (vertices) $V = n^2$.
    \item The BFS algorithm's time complexity is $O(V + E)$, but since the number of edges $E$ is proportional to $V$ in a grid, the overall complexity simplifies to $O(V)$.
\end{itemize}

However, because $V$ itself is proportional to $n^2$, the time complexity in terms of $n$ becomes $O(n^2)$. This explains the observed quadratic growth in execution time with respect to the maze dimension $n$.

\subsubsection*{Empirical Observations}

The plotted execution times closely follow a quadratic curve. Small deviations can be attributed to system performance variability and the overhead of additional operations in the code.

\subsection*{Memory Usage}

Memory usage also exhibits a quadratic growth pattern. This is expected because:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The algorithm maintains data structures proportional to the number of cells, such as the maze matrix and visited status.
    \item Each cell requires a fixed amount of memory, so total memory usage scales with $n^2$.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Memory Efficiency Considerations}

While the memory usage is acceptable for smaller mazes, it becomes significant for larger ones. Optimizations could include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Using more memory-efficient data structures (e.g., bitsets for visited flags).
    \item Implementing maze representations that store only essential information.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Algorithm Efficiency}

The BFS algorithm performs well for small to medium-sized mazes. However, for very large mazes, the quadratic time and space complexities pose challenges.

\subsubsection*{Potential Optimizations}

To improve performance on larger mazes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Heuristic Search Algorithms:} Implementing A* search with an admissible heuristic can reduce the search space by prioritizing promising paths.
    \item \textbf{Bidirectional Search:} Running simultaneous searches from the entrance and exit could potentially halve the search space.
    \item \textbf{Parallelization:} Utilizing multi-threading to explore multiple paths concurrently.
    \item \textbf{Memory Management:} Releasing memory of cells no longer needed or using iterative methods to reduce stack usage.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Conclusion}

The tests conducted validate the theoretical expectations of our maze resolution algorithm's performance. The execution time and memory usage increase quadratically with the maze size, which is inherent to the nature of the BFS algorithm on grid-based mazes.

While the algorithm is efficient and effective for smaller mazes, optimization strategies are necessary for handling larger mazes to ensure scalability and practicality.

\section*{Future Work}

Future enhancements could focus on:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Implementing optimized algorithms like A* with heuristics tailored to maze structures.
    \item Exploring alternative maze representations to reduce memory overhead.
    \item Conducting tests on mazes with varying complexity (e.g., sparse vs. dense walls) to assess the algorithm's adaptability.
    \item Profiling the code to identify and eliminate bottlenecks.
\end{itemize}
